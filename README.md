# Perfect
Google Clarity Winner (G-CW)

A unique, auditable Clarity contract that implements a defensible, enterprise-style procurement flow for Web3:

- **Best-value metric** balancing evaluator scores, reputation, early-bird & diversity bonuses, delivery pledge, and price.
- **Evaluator weights**, per-project.
- **Candidate-bounded finalization** (≤ 20) for gas safety and determinism.
- **Bookkeeping for deposits & reputation** (no token transfers — integrate SIP-010 externally for escrow/payouts).
